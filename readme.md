# AutoML for manufacturing
- This Experiment is a model that detects anomlies in untrained manufacturing data and is optimized through the AutoML framework

# Start Code
- First, download the MVTecAD dataset
- Second, Through the all_make_dataset.py code, the MVTecAD dataset is created in the learning format we propose ( Change it to suit your dataset path )
- Third, Start new_main.py

- Warning! This experiment consumes a lot of GPU memory, so use a graphics card of at least 24GB or more
